# srv3-karaoke-extractor – YouTube Karaoke Subtitle Extractor (.srv3 → .ass)

`srv3` is a Linux command-line tool designed specifically for YouTube videos that use karaoke-style, syllable-animated subtitles (the `.srv3` subtitle format).

It downloads the video, extracts YouTube’s timing-accurate karaoke subtitle data, converts it to `.ass` format (preserving syllable animation and timing), and organizes everything cleanly into your `~/Videos` directory.

This tool is built to work out of the box for **your debian-based distro**, with a fully automated installer for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems (including Xubuntu).

## 🎤 Why .srv3 / Karaoke Subtitles?

Many music videos, anime openings/endings, and lyric videos on YouTube use karaoke-style subtitles, where:

- Words or syllables animate individually
- Timing is embedded at syllable level
- Standard subtitle formats (`.srt`, `.vtt`) cannot preserve this behavior

YouTube stores this data in the `.srv3` format.

`srv3` exists specifically to:

- Extract this syllable-accurate subtitle data
- Convert it into Advanced SubStation Alpha (`.ass`)
- Preserve karaoke timing and animation correctly

---

## ✨ Features

- Designed specifically for karaoke / syllable-animated subtitles  
- Download YouTube videos in high quality  
- Extract `.srv3` subtitle tracks  
- Convert `.srv3 → .ass` with full karaoke timing  
- Automatically delete original `.srv3` files  
- Clean output structure: `~/Videos/<Video Title>/`  
- Global `srv3` command usable from any directory  
- Fully automated dependency installation for **your debian-based distro**

---

## 📦 Requirements (Installed Automatically)

The installer handles everything required for your debian-based distro, including:

- `yt-dlp`  
- `ffmpeg`  
- .NET 8 Runtime  
- YTSubConverter  
- System utilities (`curl`, `wget`, etc.)  

No manual setup is normally required.

## 📁 Repository Layout

Your repository should contain:

```
.
├── install.sh
├── srv3
├── YTSubConverter-Linux.deb
└── README.md
```

All files must remain in the same directory during installation for **your debian-based distro**.

## 🚀 Installation (Recommended for Your Debian-Based Distro)

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/TheNPC-sketch/srv3-karaoke-extractor
cd srv3-karaoke-extractor
```

2️⃣ Make installer executable:

```
chmod +x install.sh
```

3️⃣ Run the installer:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

This will:

- Install all dependencies for your distro
- Install yt-dlp
- Install .NET 8 Runtime
- Install YTSubConverter
- Register global commands:
- srv3
- ytsubconverter

🔹 Logging out and back in is recommended after installation.

## 🎬 Usage
Download karaoke-subbed videos by using the following command:

```
srv3 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" [MODE]
```

| Mode      | Output                                  | Description                                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *(none)*  | Folder in `~/Videos/<title>_<quality>/` | Downloads video + ASS, keeps everything in folder                 |
| `-burn`   | MP4 in `~/Videos/`                      | Burns subtitles into video, deletes temp files                    |
| `-burn-e` | MP4 in `~/Videos/`                      | Opens `.ass` in `micro` for editing before burning                |
| `-soft`   | MKV in `~/Videos/`                      | Muxes `.ass` as soft subtitle track (default), deletes temp files |
| `-soft-e` | MKV in `~/Videos/`                      | Opens `.ass` in `micro` for editing before muxing                 |

**Example**
```
# Download video with subtitles, keep them in a folder
./srv3.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcd1234

# Burn subtitles into MP4
./srv3.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcd1234 -burn

# Edit subtitles before burning
./srv3.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcd1234 -burn-e

# Add soft subtitles as default track (MKV)
./srv3.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcd1234 -soft

# Edit soft subtitles before muxing
./srv3.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcd1234 -soft-e
```

This workflow is specifically optimized for karaoke / syllable-animated subtitle tracks.

## 🎚 Format Selection

When running, `srv3`:

Lists all available YouTube formats

Prompts you to select the desired format code

Downloads the exact format you choose

This ensures maximum compatibility for your distro and for videos with special subtitle timing.

## 🛠 How It Works (Technical Overview)
Uses yt-dlp -F to enumerate formats

Prompts user for format selection

Downloads:

- Video
- Audio
- .srv3 karaoke subtitles
- Merges streams into MP4
- Converts subtitles:
-     .srv3 → .ass

Preserves syllable timing and karaoke effects

Cleans up intermediate files

Organizes output into `~/Videos`

All paths and tools follow Linux standards for your debian-based distro

## ❗ If install.sh Fails (Detailed Help)
**1️⃣ Confirm supported distro**

`srv3` is intended for your distro if it is:

- Ubuntu
- Xubuntu
- Kubuntu
- Linux Mint

Any Debian-based distro

~Verify:

```
lsb_release -a
```

**2️⃣ Missing .deb file**


Error:

```
YTSubConverter-Linux.deb not found
```

Fix: 
Download the Linux `.deb` for `YTSubConverter` and place it next to install.sh.


**3️⃣ .NET runtime issues**

Install manually for your distro:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dotnet-runtime-8.0
```

Verify:

```
dotnet --list-runtimes
```

**4️⃣ ytsubconverter command missing**

Manually create the wrapper:

```
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/ytsubconverter > /dev/null << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
dotnet /opt/ytsubconverter/ytsubconverter.dll "$@"
EOF
```

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ytsubconverter
```

**5️⃣ srv3 command missing**

```
sudo install -m 755 srv3 /usr/local/bin/srv3
```

**6️⃣ Re-run installer**

Safe to rerun for your distro:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

## 🧹 Uninstalling

```
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/srv3
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/ytsubconverter
sudo apt remove ytsubconverter
```

**Optionally:**

```
rm -rf ~/.srv3_config
```
